It is designed for extreme\n             scalability in networked applications through an ingenious combination of server-side \n             JavaScript, asynchronous I/O, and asynchronous\n            programming.","While only ten years old, Node.js has quickly grown in prominence and is now\n            playing a significant role. Companies, both large and small, are using it for large-scale\n            and small-scale projects. PayPal, for example, has converted many services from Java\n            to Node.js.","The Node.js architecture departs from a typical choice made by other application\n            platforms. Where threads are widely used to scale an application to fill the CPU,\n            Node.js eschews threads because of their inherent complexity. It's claimed that with\n            single-thread event-driven architectures, the memory footprint is low, throughput is\n            high, the latency profile under load is better, and the programming model is simpler.\n            The Node.js platform is in a phase of rapid growth, and many see it as a compelling\n            alternative to the traditional web application architectures using Java, PHP, Python,\n            or Ruby on Rails.","At its heart, it is a standalone JavaScript engine with extensions that is suitable for\n            general-purpose programming and that has a clear focus on application server\n            development. Even though we're comparing Node.js to application-server platforms,\n            it is not an application server. Instead, Node.js is a programming runtime akin to\n            Python, Go, or Java SE. While there are web application frameworks and application\n            servers written in Node.js, it is simply a system to execute JavaScript programs.","The key architectural choice is that Node.js is event-driven, rather than\n            multithreaded. The Node.js architecture rests on dispatching blocking operations to a\n            single-threaded event loop, with results arriving back to the caller as an event that\n            invokes an event handler function. In most cases, the event is converted into a\n            promise that is handled by an async function. Because Node.js is based on Chrome's\n            V8 JavaScript engine, the performance and feature improvements implemented in\n            Chrome quickly flow through to the Node.js platform.",'This article is from the book "Node.js web development" by David Herron']},{name:"node-capabilities",title:"The capabilities of Node.js",content:["Node.js is a platform for writing JavaScript applications outside web browsers. This is\n            not the JavaScript environment we are familiar with in web browsers! While Node.js\n            executes the same JavaScript language that we use in browsers, it doesn't have some\n            of the features associated with the browser. For example, there is no HTML DOM\n            built into Node.js.\n            Beyond its native ability to execute JavaScript, the built-in modules provide\n            capabilities like: command-line tools (in shell script style).. an interactive-terminal style of program\u2014that is, a read-eval-print loop\n            (REPL).. excellent process control functions to oversee child processes.. a buffer object to deal with binary data\n            .. TCP or UDP sockets with comprehensive, event-driven callbacks\n            .. DNS lookup .. An HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2-client server layered on top of the TCP\n            library filesystem access ..built-in rudimentary unit testing support through assertions .. etc.\n            ","The network layer of Node.js is low level while being simple to use\u2014for example, the\n            HTTP modules allow you to write an HTTP server (or client) using a few lines of\n            code. This is powerful, but it puts you, the programmer, very close to the protocol\n            requests and makes you implement precisely those HTTP headers that you should\n            return in request responses.","Typical web-application developers don't need to work at a low level of the HTTP or\n            other protocols; instead, we tend to be more productive working with higher-level\n            interfaces\u2014for example, PHP coders assume that Apache/Nginx/and so on are\n            already there providing the HTTP, and that they don't have to implement the HTTP\n            server portion of the stack. By contrast, a Node.js programmer does implement an\n            HTTP server, to which their application code is attached.","To simplify the situation, the Node.js community has several web application\n            frameworks, such as Express, providing the higher-level interfaces required by\n            typical programmers. You can quickly configure an HTTP server with baked-in\n            capabilities, such as sessions, cookies, serving static files, and logging, letting\n            developers focus on their business logic. Other frameworks provide OAuth 2 support\n            or focus on REST APIs, and so on.\n            The community of folks using Node.js has built an amazing variety of things on this\n            foundation.",'This article is from the book "Node.js web development" by David Herron']},{name:"learn-react",title:"What makes React a good library?",content:["What makes a JavaScript library good?
